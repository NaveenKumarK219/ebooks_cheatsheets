How to insert code snippet in Microsoft Word

1. Go to "insert" tab, click "object" button (it's on the right).
2. Choose "OpenDocument Text" which will open a new embedded word document.
3. Copy and paste your code from Visual Studio / Eclipse inside this embedded word pages.
4. Save and close.

The result looks very nice. Here are the advantages of this method:

The code keeps its original layout and colour.
The code is separated from the rest of the document, as if it was a picture or a chart
Spelling errors won't be highlighted in the code (this is cool !)
And it takes only few seconds.
